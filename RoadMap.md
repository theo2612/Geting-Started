5. Go on interviews
	1. Take notes - bring a small notebook
		1. I felt confident before my first interview and absolutely devastated after. I didn't know answers to basic questions they asking - OSI model, white list vs black list, XXS, sql injection, ets.Â  so I took notes on the back of paperwork they gave me. I don't advise that. I took notes on what interviewers were looking for over the next 4 years. My search was longer due to covid. 
	2. You have 2 gatekeepers to pass. 
		1. First is HR or an algorithm and second are the interviewers themselves. If you don't know something they are asking you, ask them if it is ok, (I never had anyone tell me 'no') jot it down, and learn it for the next interview.
	3. just go on interviews, get comfortable hearing 'no', discover what you they are looking for and learn it,
6. Don't compare yourself to where others 
	1. In their journey
